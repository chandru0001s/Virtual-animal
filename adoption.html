<blockquote><p style="font-family: garamond;font-size: 200%;">We have hundreds of animals waiting eagerly to find their forever homes. Many of them have been rescued from the streets and each of them is deserving of a loving, caring family they can call their own. 

            It’s a lot easier to adopt than you think. We promise. And we’re here to guide you every step of the way. </p></blockquote>

<p style="font-size: 300%;font-family: garamond;text-align: center;">Adoption is a commitment</p>
<blockquote><p style="font-family: garamond;font-size: 200%;">Adopting an animal is not a decision to take lightly. Cats and dogs can live as long as 15 years.

                We want to ensure that our animals go to people who will provide them with a clean, safe, family environment, will feed them properly, take care of them when they are sick, and will – above all – love them long time. </p></blockquote>

<p style="font-size: 300%;font-family: garamond;text-align: center;">Choosing the right pet</p>
<blockquote><p style="font-family: garamond;font-size: 300%;">Before you decide to adopt, we recommend you consider a few factors:

<li style="font-family: garamond;font-size: 200%;">Do you have lots of time to entertain an energetic animal or are you looking for an older, calmer pet?</li>
<li style="font-family: garamond;font-size: 200%;">Do you have an outdoor space that your pet can explore safely? Or would you prefer an animal that’s comfortable spending time indoors?</li>
<li style="font-family: garamond;font-size: 200%;">Do you already have a pet? If yes, what kind of temperament does your existing pet have?</li>
<li style="font-family: garamond;font-size: 200%;">If you already have a pet, please bring them with you when you come to the shelter. Photos of your help will help us advise you on who from our animal family will be a good fit for you.</li></p></blockquote>
